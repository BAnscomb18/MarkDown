## *What is Markdown?*
Markdown is a simple form of text that non programmers can write that is easy to read and can be converted directly to HTML. 
You can write it once and export it anywhere. It uses very simple formatting syntax and it is simpler than HTML. 
It also doesn't have all of the menus associated with most text editing programs. To format text, Markdown uses punctuation
and characters you're already familiar with such as; 
- Hashtags, 
- Asterisk, 
- Minus' or plus' etc. 

## *What is Markdown used for? Why?*
Markdown can be used to format headers, emphasis, and lists, and to add images and links. The concept is to produce files that are as simple to read as plain text, but that have everything you require to create HTML to distribute on the web. This brings us to the next part of Markdown. Markdown is also a text processor, whereby it takes Markdown text input and gives out correct HTML output.
