## *What is Markdown?*
Markdown is a simple form of text that non programmers can write that is easy to read and can be converted directly to HTML. 
You can write it once and export it anywhere. It uses very simple formatting syntax and it is simpler than HTML. 
It also doesn't have all of the menus associated with most text editing programs. To format text, Markdown uses punctuation
and characters you're already familiar with such as; 
- Hashtags, 
- Asterisk, 
- Minus' or plus' etc. 

## *What is Markdown used for? Why?*
Markdown can be used to format headers, emphasis, and lists, and to add images and links. The concept is to produce files that are as simple to read as plain text, but that have everything you require to create HTML to distribute on the web. This brings us to the next part of Markdown. Markdown is also a text processor, whereby it takes Markdown text input and gives out correct HTML output.

## *Markdown Syntax*
<pre><code>
# This is a H1
''' # This is a H1
## This is a H2
''' ## This is a H2
</code></pre>
To headings you simply put hashtags in front of each line you want to be headings

# *Lists*
You can make a list by using asterisks, minus' or plus character, however the only thing to look out for it to ensure that you use the same character consistently within the list. You have to enter the space bar after each character. To create an ordered list you begin with the number and then use a full stop or a bracket  ')' and a space. If you didn't want to start a list then you can backslash to escape. 

# *Block quotes*

A block quote is a quotation in a text document that is away from the main text as a paragraph. Each time you use > you are writing a paragraph.

> ## Blockquoted header
>
> This is block quoted text.
>
> Here is the more quoted text.
> 

Here is an example of what it would look like:
```
> ## Blockquoted header
>
> This is block quoted text.
>
> Here is the more quoted text.
> 
```
