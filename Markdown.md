# *What is markdown*
Markdown is a simple form of text that non programmers can write that is easy to read and can be converted directly to HTML. 
You can write it once and export it anywhere. It uses very simple formatting syntax and it is simpler than HTML. 
It also doesn't have all of the menus associated with most text editing programs. To format text, Markdown uses punctuation
and characters you're already familiar with such as; 
- Hashtags, 
- Asterisk 
- Minus' or plus' etc.
